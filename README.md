This code provides a new implementation of the model from Ott et al. 2021 and tests is against hypotheses from our Restaurant Row and WebSurf data.   It generates the figures provided in our response.

It was written to work in Matlab 2021a (9.10.0.1602886) by A. David Redish.

To generate the figures, run KP_bioRxiv_figures.
